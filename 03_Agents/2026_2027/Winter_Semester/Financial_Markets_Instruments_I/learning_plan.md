## Scope and coverage

The authorized bounded scope is all checked supplied Weeks1–3. This is not whole-semester or exam completeness. The retention horizon is unknown (`null`). Course identity JEM035 is preserved from existing records; no new course code is inferred. [Ingestion state](ingestion_state.json) revision3 is complete under `INGEST-20261018-FMI-R3-COMPLETE`. The [current pass](../../../runtime/ingest/logs/20261018T195113+0200_weeks1-3_five_courses.md#fmi-final-independent-review-and-course-publication) independently certifies FMI even while its other-course sections are in progress; prior checked Week1–2 coverage is retained through its linked successful passes. [Manifest](source_manifest.md) records every selected heading, fingerprint and asset.

| Supported note capability | Objectives | Coverage / limits |
|---|---|---|
| Contract timing, clearing, limits and supporting organization | O001 | Full contract content; handbook cutoff/live dates remain qualified |
| Quotation, payoffs, margin accounts, calls and added-position funding | O002–O005 | All source examples and conditional funding/withdrawal rules included |
| Basis, convergence, matched hedges and stated deferred-payment value | O006–O008 | Matching/daily-cash-flow timing qualifications retained |
| Index, currency, rate and bond tutorial futures; repo/CTD | O009–O013 | Hypothetical contracts, source day-count/arithmetic discrepancies, full-price and eligibility limits retained |
| Two-sided carry and calendar spreads | O014–O015 | Simple-rate reversible terminal/interval model; no silent compounding substitution |
| Covered parity and uncovered carry/peg example | O016–O017 | Quotation/horizon changes explicit; expectation is not a guarantee; NDF definition qualified |
| Compound zero-coupon forwards and simple index replication | O018–O019 | Separate conventions, source terminal-payoff typo and implementation limits retained |

Later source weeks and unassigned later chapters are excluded. External videos/current legal/broker claims, live contract terms, actual delivery-basket selection and whole-syllabus/exam completeness are unsupported. Exactly50 overall assessment points and conflicting administrative details remain course-team questions. No learner evidence, due dates or mastery are inferred. All selected finished notes and assets are included; no newly enumerated note candidate in this course lies outside Weeks1–3. Hub navigation/introduction is context rather than an additional assessed objective.

Contract identity and signed units precede margins and hedges. Week2 instruments instantiate these mechanisms. Week3 carry uses both matching and funding boundaries, then branches into calendar funding, currency parity, zero coupons and index replication. The dependency graph is acyclic and every prerequisite appears earlier. Independent branches may be reordered; skips require compatible committed evidence under the lesson rules. Every lesson includes diagnostic prompt/key, complete explanatory passages, worked example, completion practice, two immediate and two delayed full checks, correction, component rubric and stopping route.

## Execution and assessment contract

This substantive revision adopts `self-contained-lessons-v1` from [[03_Agents/references/LESSON_CONTENT.md]]. Deliver embedded full note passages and figures without requiring original-note retrieval. Preserve source notation/language, distinguishing simple from compound accumulation and each currency quotation. Old O001–O013 item IDs/versions, full keys, named six acquisition routes, assistance/tool conditions and finite-bank restrictions remain binding; notation typesetting alone does not change them. Each new O014–O019 full form covers every listed component, so each of its six allowed pairs does so twice. Worked, supported, diagnostic and narrow correction forms cannot substitute. Generated explanation/practice can remain within the established method after checking; it cannot replace named evidence items.

Delayed evidence requires an unused unassisted form before recap, at least24 actual elapsed hours after acquisition and most recent relevant exposure. Early D forms can count only through an allowed acquisition route and cannot be counted again later. Unknown help/exposure conditions are unscorable for independence. Teach alone records actual outcomes; recall alone schedules from committed evidence.

## Revisions and evidence compatibility

P005/V003 is a notation-clarification successor to P004/V003 at the same ingestion3. Five O006 supported/immediate/delayed keys and one O007 explanation step replace inherited `B_T0` shorthand with explicit $B_T=0$. The checked note and complete lesson explanations already state this conditional zero-basis-at-maturity identity. No time subscript $T_0$ is intended. Numeric results, assumptions, objective revisions, criterion/item versions, acquisition routes, tools, timing rules and gates are unchanged. The exact complete P004 bundle is preserved in [P004 history](curriculum_history/P004/learning_plan.md), and every exact P004 evidence tuple is explicitly compatible without reassessment. The earlier substantive reconciliation remains the academic baseline.

P004/V003/ingestion3 preserves the exact prior complete P003 bundle under [curriculum_history/P003/](curriculum_history/P003/learning_plan.md); P001/P002 history remains untouched. O001–O013 stable identities are retained with objective revision incremented for full-content teaching preparation. Their criteria, item contracts, success components and evidence conditions remain unchanged after semantic inspection of byte-identical academic Week1–2 notes. Exact approved old tuples are carried forward and each exact active P003 tuple is added explicitly in both index and lesson. No response is regraded and no reassessment requirement is imposed for an unchanged criterion. O014–O019 are new IDs with revision1/C1, no compatible old evidence and no claimed learner result. No objectives are split, merged, retired or recycled. New Week3 capabilities require their own actual acquisition evidence. Source version advances for the new notes and additive hub; old assessment teaching/formula typography does not alter academic scope.

## Validation and readiness

Owner checks include current complete ingest transaction, note/asset fingerprints, exact checked headings, complete reused-section fidelity, source/figure links, matching plan/manifest/all-lesson tuple, preserved P003 bytes, unused versions, acyclic dependencies, all mandatory lesson blocks and six routes per lesson. New hypothetical keys are recomputed directly from the displayed checked identities. The independent curriculum review must cover every old/new lesson, permitted route, key, source qualification, complete-content reuse and history before atomic publication. Review evidence is recorded in the final review appendix; a draft alone is not readiness. After publication records.py verify is required for each of the19 indexed ready lessons and the ingest state. The vault has nine pre-existing absent empty course mirrors; no records are fabricated for them.

## Final independent curriculum review

Reviewer `/root/plan_owner/fmi_curriculum_check`, separate host `uni_curriculum_checker` profile requested `gpt-6-astra/high` (actual runtime settings not independently host-attested), returned **no unresolved material findings; curriculum review passes for publication** for all19 final lessons, every prepared prompt/key/rubric/diagnostic,114 permitted pairs, delayed/exposure restrictions, complete-note support,21 figures,33 fingerprints and P001–P003 compatibility/history. It verified50 complete reused passages and all15 exact P003 archive files. Findings repaired and finally rechecked: four new prerequisite diagnostic gaps, O018 multiplication escaping, O006 superscripts, six O013 math identities and all13 active escalation contexts. No original-material audit or learner evidence was performed. The final academic-content review binds to the pre-appendix intent SHA256 `039bb14616d7cf6f6802dce2943e282dcf431565977d94dc4344f73f505bc3df`; this appendix records the actual result without altering reviewed academic content. Owner must still publish atomically and verify every ready lesson after commit.

## Notation clarification and independent recheck gate

The HTML math review identified ambiguous inherited `B_T0` shorthand in five O006 answer keys and O007 explanation step 3. The plan owner inspected all six active occurrences against the finished checked note [Basis, convergence and futures hedging](../../../../01_Notes/2026_2027/Winter_Semester/Financial_Markets_Instruments_I/Week_1/Basis_Convergence_and_Futures_Hedging.md), specifically “Why the prices converge at delivery” and “A purchase hedge, derived step by step”. The first states $F_T=S_T$, hence $B_T=0$, conditional on matching/eligible assets and feasible trades; the second explicitly uses $B_T=0$ to derive the maturity hedge result. O006 explanation step 4 and its complete reused note, and O007’s complete reused purchase-hedge explanation, already establish the intended equality. The repair therefore makes the supported zero-basis condition explicit as $B_T=0$, preserving the existing qualifications; it introduces no different time index, pricing identity or assessment condition. No note error was identified, and no checked note is edited.

The previous full independent curriculum approval covered all 19 lessons and 114 permitted acquisition routes. This bounded successor preserves those complete lessons, all 33 selected note/asset fingerprints, all contracts and the exact 21-file P004 snapshot and journal; previous histories remain untouched. The same independent FMI curriculum checker must confirm the final exact P005 repair intent and affected context, including the zero-basis support and evidence compatibility, before atomic publication. This factual preparation record does not claim that pending review or publication has succeeded; the actual final digest and receipt are recorded in the [task session](../../../runtime/sessions/2026-10-18-week3-ingest-html.md). No learner result is inferred.
